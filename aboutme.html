      <h3>Biography</h3>
    <div class="Bio">
      <p>
        I was born in Jerusalem, Israel <span style="color:blue">"The Holy City"</span> in the year 1986. I grew up on a
        Kibbutz <span style="color:black"> "a small commune"</span> in Israel until the age of 6. At that age my dad was promoted
        and was aked to relocate to<span style="color:red"> Saint Louis</span>, MO for his job. So <span style="color:blue"> Saint Louis</span> was where we
        were headed. My parents, three brothers and I packed our stuff and headed to the
        U.S.A. where we began our new adventure. <span style="color:red"> Saint Louis</span> is where I call home, because I lived there
         for most of my life. I have a deep love for <span style="color:blue"> Saint Louis</span> because of all the wonderful
        friends I have made there throughout my life, and all the great adventures that took place
        there.
