  <h3>Biography</h3>
  <p div class="Bio">
    I was born in Jerusalem, Israel "The Holy City" in the year 1986. I grew up on a
    Kibbutz "a small commune" in Israel until the age of 6. At that age my dad was promoted
    and was aked to relocate to Saint Louis, MO for his job. So Saint Louis was where we
    were headed. My parents, three brothers and I packed our stuff and headed to the
    U.S.A. where we began our new adventure. Saint Louis is where I call home because I lived
    most my life there. I have a deep love for Saint Louis because of all the wonderful
    friends I have made there throughout my life </p>
