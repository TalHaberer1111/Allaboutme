    <p>
      My dear Grandma Hazel passed away on Thursday January 7th, 2016. She
      was an amazing woman full of <span style="color:red">Love</span>. I was really close to my grandmother and will
      always remember her beautiful <span style="color:red">soul</span>. She will forever hold the top place in my heart.
      She died peacefully playing her favorite game of scrabble. I now have a <span style:"color:red">guardian</span> angel
      watching over me.

        *<em>Rest in Peace</em>*
